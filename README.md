# Invoice_manager
The invoice manager is a GUI program that allows the user to quickly create and populate new invoices based on a customizable template. The program also tracks the invoices' ongoing status via a MongoDB database and visualizes them via a piechart. 
In addition, there is an finance tab, where the user can quickly look up the most recent exchange rates for EUR, USD and GBP. This tab also contains a summary of the user's cashflows
The user can  move, copy, archive and delete  invoice files. The program allows for projects folders to be created as well, so the user can properly organize their work. 

To use the program, the user has to download the invoiceman.exe file and invoice_template.pdf contained herein. Please note that in order for the program to run properly, the user has to make sure that "invoice_template.pdf" remains with the same name and is stored in the same directory as the .exe file.
The program is currently compatible with Windows only.
