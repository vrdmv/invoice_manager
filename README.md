# Invoice_manager
The invoice manager is a simple gui program which allows the user to create new invoices based on a customizable template
and track their ongoing status. Status is tracked via a MongoDB database and visualized via a piechart. The user can also move, copy, archive and delete the invoice files. The program allows for projects to be created as well, so the user can properly organize their files. In addition, there is an exchange rate tab, where the user can quickly look up the most recent exchange rates for EUR, USD and GBP. 

In order to use the program, there is an .exe file in the executable folder contained herein. The program is currently compatible with Windows only.
