# Invoice_manager
The invoice manager is a simple gui program which allows the user to create new invoices based on a customizable template
and track their ongoing status. Status is tracked via a MongoDB database and visualized via a piechart. The user can also move, copy, archive and delete the invoice files. The program allows for projects folders to be created as well, so the user can properly organize their files. In addition, there is an exchange rate tab, where the user can quickly look up the most recent exchange rates for EUR, USD and GBP. 

To use the program, the user has to simply run the .exe file contained herein. Please note that in order for the program to run properly, the user has to make sure that the "invoice_template.pdf" is in the same directory as the .exe file, and that it remains with the same name.
The program is currently compatible with Windows only.
