# Invoice_manager

  The invoice manager is a desktop GUI program that allows the user to efficinetly create and populate new invoices based on a customizable template. The program also dynamically tracks and updates the ongoing status of each individual invoice via a MongoDB database and visualizes the information via a piechart. 
  In addition, there is a finance tab where the user can quickly convert currency values, using the most recent exchange rates for EUR, GBP, USD. This tab also provides for a summary of the user's cashflows, depending on the status of each individual invoice.
The user can  move, copy, archive and delete invoice files. The program allows for project folders to be created as well, so the user can properly organize their work. 
  To use the program, the user has to download the invoiceman.exe file and invoice_template.pdf contained in the executable folder above. Please note that in order for the program to run properly, the user has to make sure that "invoice_template.pdf" remains with the same name and is stored in the same directory as the .exe file.
  The program is currently compatible with Windows only.
