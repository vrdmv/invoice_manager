# Invoice_manager

  The invoice manager is a simple desktop application that allows the user to efficiently:
    - create and populate new invoices based on a customizable template;
    - track and update the ongoing status of each individual invoice via a MongoDB database;
    - get a visual overview of all the invoices' status via a piechart. 
  In addition, there is a finance tab where the user can:
    - quickly convert currency values, using the most recent exchange rates for EUR, GBP, USD;
    - get a summary of the user's cashflows, depending on the status of each individual invoice.
  Lastly, the program allows for the user to:
    - move, copy, archive and delete invoice files; 
    - create project folders so they can properly organize their work.
  To use the program, the user has to download the invoiceman.exe file and invoice_template.pdf contained in the executable folder above. Please note that in order for the program to run properly, the user has to make sure that "invoice_template.pdf" remains with the same name and is stored in the same directory as the .exe file. The program is currently compatible with Windows only.
